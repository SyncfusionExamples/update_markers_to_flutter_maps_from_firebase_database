# Update markers to Flutter Maps from Firebase Database

A marker identifies a location on a map and a very useful feature for many real-time use cases. It may be difficult to manually update these marker locations if the marker locations are changing more often. So, it is better to have them in a database. In this article, we are going to see how we can access and update the markers in Flutter Maps from a Firebase Realtime database.
We are not going to discuss how we are going to create a realtime database with firebase in this article. For that please refer to this framework documentation for creating a database in a Firebase console and connecting your Flutter application with that Firebase database.
